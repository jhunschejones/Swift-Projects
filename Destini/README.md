# Destini

### Overview
I built this app as a part of The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp. It is a text-based, choose your own adventure game with a responsive UI built in the MVC application design pattern.

### Lessons learned
Every time I face a storyboard without auto layout constraints in place it still feels a bit daunting. As a result, I have taken every opportunity during this bootcamp to choose the starting version of each project that does not have the layout completed yet whenever I can. This app is no different, and I actually started from fully blank storyboards to implement the assigned design.

After completing [Quizzler 2](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Swift-Projects/tree/master/Quizzler-2), it turned out that my comfortability with the storyboard was actually improving and I found the experience of laying out Destini much more fun as a result, even though it had a few new elements to wrangle. I was able to create a semi-transparent background behind the story text to improve readability, and I even learned how to create a custom class to give a View rounded corners!

The other design element I'm proud of in this code is how I used clear data structures for each element involved, from the story to the scenes and the choices. This allowed me to write very simple controller and model functions, and for the data structures to make intuitive sense at each step along the way.
