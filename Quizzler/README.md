# Quizzler

## Overview
This is an app I created as a part of The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp. It is a quiz app with a responsive layout that follows the MVC design pattern. It's also the most dynamic of the app interfaces we've built so far, where the data shown on the screen is changed programatically.

## Additions
I chose the starting outline for this project that did not yet have any responsive layout constraints in place. This allowed me to practice optimizing a layout for multiple screen sizes, and I'm very proud of the final result, which works smoothly in both vertical and horizontal orientations on a variety of devices.

While we were refactoring the application code out of a single view controller into separate models, I diverged a bit from the instructors guidance in order to structure my methods in my preferred code style. _(Rather than optimize for fewer method calls, I prefer smaller methods that are clearly named so that the reader understands at a glance what the app is doing within the context of each layer of abstraction.)_
