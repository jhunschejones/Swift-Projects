# Swift-Projects

This repo houses collection of small projects I created while learning swift in the summer of 2020.

## IOS Bootcamp
I started my Swift journey with The App Brewery IOS bootcamp. Most of the first set projects in this repo were completed while I was taking their course. For the work-along projects I found that I enjoyed all the helpful pointers and guided learning the bootcamp offered, but I also tried to make small _(or big!)_ improvements along the way to push my learning and keep the classes engaging!

After each work-along project, I did a project on my own to test that I was able to retain what I had learned in the preceding material. I've tried to indicate below and in the app README's where designs started with The App Brewery and where I took my own path. In the end, I loved the experience of learning a new language and a whole new side of software engineering while building these apps. I'm looking forward to building some larger scale Swift projects in the future!
