# Quizzler 2

## Overview
This is an app I created as a part of The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp. It is a quiz app with a responsive layout that follows the MVC design pattern. This project specifically is a follow up to the [Quizzler](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Swift-Projects/tree/master/Quizzler) app, and adds multiple choice questions.

## Additions
This project extends the original[Quizzler](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Swift-Projects/tree/master/Quizzler) bootcamp app, and was completed as a bonus challenge. A set of multiple choice questions was provided, and I restructured the Quizzler code I had previously written in order to accommodate three, dynamic choices per question (instead of just True / False). Since the original app had already been refactored to follow the MVC design pattern, I found this addition relatively painless and fun! It was cool to see how small, well designed functions make for quick refactoring and easy extensibility.

As of this challenge I am continuing to work on building my skills with the storyboard tool for composing UIs that feel and look natural on a variety of screen sizes. I am most proud of the responsive UI that I shaped in this app to accommodate the extra elements required for the challenge.
