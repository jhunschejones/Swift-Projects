# Magic 8 Ball

### Overview
This is a single-page app I built while working through The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp. It's a quicker one, and it takes user input and selects an image at random from a list of assets to display on the screen.

### Lessons learned
Unlike some of the other apps in this course, I did not do any assets or significant design work here. It was cool to hook the UI components up to the ViewController though, and seeing that I could manipulate them from the code right away felt like a bit of tangible progress in this new and exciting world of IOS development. I'm excited for what's next!
