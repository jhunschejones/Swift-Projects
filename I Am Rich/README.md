# I Am Rich

### Overview
I built this app as a part of The App Brewery IOS bootcamp. It was a work-along project and I learned a lot about XCode, managing app assets and image alignment.

### Additions
To push myself further than what we did together in the course, I added some constraints to the image layouts so that the app would work on several sizes of phone.

In addition to the app itself, I also designed the app icon using an online design tool. This was my first real taste of what kind of images and patterns will actually be visible in something this small!
