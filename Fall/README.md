# Fall

### Overview
I built this entire app on my own to test the progress I made during the first module of The App Brewery IOS bootcamp. It displays an image on a single page and works on a few different sizes of device.

### Lessons Learned
I created all the assets for this app, gaining familiarity with some online sizing and design tooling to gather together all the image sizes required. This is the second app icon I've ever designed, and I went through some trial and error to land on the final image. I am still learning what translates well at the app icon size and what looks too busy!

I originally put text over the app image in XCode, but soon found I didn't have the flexibility to tweak the font and styling to the extent I needed to. Instead, I created the design with the text at full size and then generated all the asset sizes required to place the image as the background of the app.
