# Xylophone

### Overview
This is an app I completed as a part of The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp. The design and layout of the app was provided, and I worked along with the bootcamp to incorporates AVFoundation to add audio functionality to the app.

### Additions
When we were reviewing the apple documentation during the course, I liked that it is possible to change the playback category to play a sound even when the phone is on silent. As a user, I'm always frustrated when simple sound clip apps require me to mess with my ringer settings, so this seemed like a neat feature to add in to the final app.

As an added challenge in the course, we added a little opacity change to the buttons when they were pressed. I liked this idea, but found the default button hi-lighting behavior took away from the affect a bit. I modified the type of buttons being used and now the interface reacts nicely to button presses in a way that feels expected!
