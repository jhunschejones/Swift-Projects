# Dicee

### Overview
I built this app as a part of The App Brewery IOS bootcamp. It was a work-along project and I learned about modifying app components in code and handling user input. The app allows the user to click a button and it simulates two dice being rolled and landing on random faces.

### Additions
After completing the work-along portion of the bootcamp, I adjusted the app to not only roll the dice when the button was clicked, but to also keep track of the _last_ role and use this information to avoid duplicate roles. Obviously real dice can roll the same thing twice, but without fancy animation, it is hard for the user to tell that the dice have rolled successfully if the values don't change. The end result is a bit of Swift code that was fun to put together, and an app that feels a little more fun to use!
