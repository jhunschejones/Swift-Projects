# Auto Layout

### Overview
This app explores constraints in order to provide a truly responsive user interface across different size classes. The code and design of the app came from The App Brewery's IOS bootcamp course, and I applied the constraints and responsive tweaks starting from that.

### Lessons learned
Before working on this module in the bootcamp, I only knew about alignment constraints. That worked for UI's with one, centered item, but could only get me so far on busier layouts. While working on this app I learned how to pin elements relative to each other, and how to use view containers to group elements for repositioning depending on the devices size class.
